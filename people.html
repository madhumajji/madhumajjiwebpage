                        <p>Michael Gumoshabe is a Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering at Ohio University. He holds a Bachelor of Engineering in Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering from Kyambogo University in Uganda and a Master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom. His doctoral research focuses on multiphase flow systems in oil and gas pipelines, with particular emphasis on the complex interactions between gas and liquid phases during transportation. He investigates how flow regimes influence internal pipeline corrosion, seeking to uncover the mechanisms through which flow conditions accelerate or mitigate material degradation. The overarching goal of his research is to develop predictive models and mitigation strategies that improve flow assurance, extend pipeline integrity, and enable the safe and sustainable operation of oil and gas infrastructure. Beyond research, he enjoys football, music, and traveling.</p>
