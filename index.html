                <h2>About Our Research</h2>
                <p>Electrochemistry offers a new paradigm for chemical engineering, as reactions can be performed under mild conditions with renewable electricity. Indeed, a diverse array of electrochemical transformations can be achieved at the lab-scale in batch quantities, however the transition to high throughput, continuous modes of operation requires judicious reactor engineering, sometimes deviating from traditional process design rules. To enable the next generation of sustainable chemical manufacturing, our group leverages fundamental chemical and electrochemical engineering principles to design and intensify electrosynthetic processes.</p>

He is from Ghana, West Africa, and earned a BSc in Petroleum Engineering from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) in November 2023. After graduation, he worked as an Operations Engineer at the Ghana National Gas Company. His research focuses on modeling multiphase flow systems to evaluate and predict their impact on corrosion in the oil and gas transport pipelines. Outside of academics, Abdallah enjoys watching football and is a devoted supporter of Liverpool FC.</span>

                            <span>I am Michael Gumoshabe and I am from Uganda. I am a PhD Candidate in Mechanical Engineering. My research focuses on multiphase flow systems in oil and gas pipelines, with a particular emphasis on understanding the complex interactions that occur between gas, liquid, and sometimes solid phases during transportation. Specifically, I study flow pattern regimes, analyzing how different regimes form under varying operating conditions and how they influence the efficiency and stability of fluid transportation. Beyond flow, I am also investigating the implications of these regimes on internal pipeline corrosion, seeking to establish the mechanisms through which flow conditions accelerate or mitigate material degradation. The ultimate goal of my research is to contribute to the development of predictive models and mitigation strategies that can improve flow assurance, extend pipeline integrity, and enhance the safe and sustainable operation of oil and gas transportation systems. Outside research, I enjoy football, music and travelling.</span>
